Feature descriptors matching in computer vision is the process of finding corresponding features between two images or frames. This is commonly used in tasks like image stitching, object recognition, and image registration. The key steps involved are feature detection, feature description, and feature matching.

- Feature Detection: This step identifies distinctive points or regions in an image that can be matched across different images. Popular algorithms for feature detection include SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF).

- Feature Description: After detecting features, descriptors are computed to describe each feature's appearance. These descriptors encode information about the feature's local neighborhood. Examples of descriptors include SIFT descriptors, SURF descriptors, and ORB descriptors.

- Feature Matching: Finally, feature matching involves finding corresponding features between two images based on their descriptors. This is typically done using algorithms like nearest neighbor matching or RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus).

In this code:

- We load two images (image1.jpg and image2.jpg) and convert them to grayscale.
- ORB detector is used to detect keypoints and compute descriptors for each image.
- BFMatcher is used for matching descriptors between the two images.
- Matches are sorted by distance and only the top matches are visualized using drawMatches.
